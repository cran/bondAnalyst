#'Calculates Macaulay Duration of a traditional Fixed-Rate Bond.
#'@details
#'According to Adams and Smith (2019),the duration of a bond measures the sensitivity of the bond`'`s full price (including accrued interest) to changes in bond`'`s yield-to-maturity or, more generally, to changes in benchmark interest rates. Duration estimates changes in the bond price assuming that variables other than the yield-to-maturity or benchmark rates are held constant. Most importantly, the time-to-maturity is unchanged. Therefore, duration measures the instantaneous (or, at least, same-day) change in the bond price. The accrued interest is the same, so it is the flat price that goes up or down when the full price changes. Duration is a useful measure because it represents the approximate amount of time a bond would have to be held for the market discount rate at purchase to be realized if/when there is a single change in interest rate. If the bond is held for the duration period, an increase from reinvesting coupons is offset by a decrease in price if interest rates increase and a decrease from reinvesting coupons is offset by an increase in price if interest rates decrease.
#'Macaulay duration is named after Frederick Macaulay, the Canadian economist who first wrote about this measure in a book published in 1938. This method calculates the Macaulay duration of a traditional fixed-rate bond (Adams & Smith, 2019).
#'Here, \code{n} is number of periods, \code{ytm} is yield-to-maturity, \code{coupon} is dollar value of the coupon payment,\code{maturityVal} is maturity Value,\code{daysCpnToSettle} is the number of days from the last coupon payment to the settlement date, and \code{daysCouponPeriod} is the number of days in the coupon period.
#'@param n A number.
