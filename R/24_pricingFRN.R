#'Calculates Price of a Floating-Rate Note (FRN).
#'@details
#'Floating-rate notes are very different from a fixed-rate bond. The interest payments on a floating rate note, which often is called a floater or an FRN, are not fixed. Instead, they vary from period to period depending on the current level of a reference interest rate. The interest payments could go up or down; that is why they `“`float.`"` In principle, a floater has a stable price even in a period of volatile interest rates. With a traditional fixed-income security, interest rate volatility affects the price because the future cash flows are constant. With a floating rate note, interest rate volatility affects future interest payments. The valuation of a floating rate note needs a pricing model. Suppose that the yield spread required by investors is 40 bps over the reference rate, DM = 0.0040. The assumed discount rate per period is 0.825 percent. For N = 4, the FRN is priced at 100.196 per 100 of par value. This floater is priced at a premium above par value because the quoted margin is greater than the discount margin (Adams & Smith, 2019).
#'Based on the information provided, the method \code{pricingFRN()} is developed to compute Price of a Floating-Rate Note (FRN) for the values passed to its five arguments. Here, \code{estRtrn} is a vector of estimated returns on FRN (this does not include repayment of the principal), \code{t} is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of periods, \code{mv} represents Maturity Value, \code{maturityPeriod} is number of evenly spaced periods to maturity, and \code{estDisc} is assumed discount rate per period. The given examples show various ways in which the arguments can be passed to \code{pricingFRN()}.
