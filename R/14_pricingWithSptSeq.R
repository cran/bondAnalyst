#'Calculate Present Value or the Price of the Bond using two different Sequences of Spot Rates.
#'@details
#'The method  \code{pricingWithSptSeq()} is developed to compute the Price of Bond using Sequences of the Spot Rates. So,  \code{pricingWithSptSeq()} gives the Price of Bond using two different series or sequences of Spot Rates for values passed to its five arguments. Here \code{cpns} represents the dollar values of all the coupon payments,\code{sp} is a vector of spot rates, \code{t} is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of years till maturity, \code{mv} is Maturity Value, and \code{n} is number of years till maturity. The output is rounded off to three decimal places. The given examples show various ways in which the arguments can be passed to \code{pricingWithSptSeq()}.
#'@param cpns A vector.

#'@param t A vector.
#'@param mv A number.
#'@param n A number.
#'@return Input values to five arguments  \code{cpns} , \code{sp},\code{t}, \code{mv}, and \code{n}.
