#'Calculate Present Value or the Price of the Bond using Spot Rates.
#'@details
#'When a fixed-rate bond is priced using the market discount rate, the same discount rate is used for each cash flow. A more fundamental approach to calculate the price of a bond is to use a sequence of market discount rates that correspond to the cash flow dates. These market discount rates are called spot rates. Spot rates are yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds maturing at the date of each cash flow. Sometimes, these are called zero rates (Adams & Smith, 2019).
#'Based on the information provided, the method  \code{pricingWithSpots()} is developed to compute the Price of Bond using the Spot Rates. So,  \code{pricingWithSpots()} gives the Price of Bond using Spots for values passed to its five arguments. Here, \code{coupons} represent the dollar values of all the coupon payments, \code{spots} is a vector of spot rates, \code{times} is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of years till maturity, \code{mv} is Maturity Value, and \code{n} is number of years till maturity. The output is rounded off to two decimal places. The given examples show various ways in which the arguments can be passed to \code{pricingWithSpots()}.
#'Suppose that the one-year spot rate is 2 percent, the two-year spot rate is 3 percent, and the three-year spot rate is 4 percent. Then, the price of a three-year bond that makes a 5 percent annual coupon payment is 102.960.
