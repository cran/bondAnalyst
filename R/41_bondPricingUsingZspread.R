#'Calculates Bond Price using the given value of a Z-Spread and spot rates taken from the spots curve.
#'@details
#'According to information provided by Adams and Smith (2019), the method \code{pricingWithZspread()} is developed to compute Bond Price using the given value of a Z-Spread and spot rates taken from the spots curve. Here, \code{cpns} is vector of Coupon Payments,  \code{spots} is a vector of spot rates taken from the spots curve, \code{t} is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of years under consideration, \code{mv} is maturity value of the bond, \code{n} is number of years for which spots are available, and \code{zSprd} is given value of a Z-spread.
#'@param cpns A vector.
#'@param spots A vector.
#'@param t A vector.
#'@param mv A number.
#'@param n A number.
#'@param zSprd A number.
#'@return Input values to six arguments \code{cpns},  \code{spots} ,\code{t},\code{mv}, \code{n} and \code{zSprd}.
