#'Calculates the G-Spread which is the spread between the yields-to-maturity on the corporate bond and that of government bond having the same maturity.
#'@details
#'According to information provided by Adams and Smith (2019), the method \code{computingGspread()} is developed to calculate G-Spread for given values of yields-to-maturity on the corporate bond and that of government bond having the same maturity. Here, \code{ytmCorpBond} stands for yields-to-maturity on the corporate bond and \code{ytmBenchGovtBond} denotes yields-to-maturity on government bond with the same maturity. An output with the value 0.02327 means G-Spread of 232.7 bps.
#'@param ytmCorpBond A number.
#'@param ytmBenchGovtBond A number.
#'@return Input values to two arguments  \code{ytmCorpBond} and \code{ytmBenchGovtBond}.
