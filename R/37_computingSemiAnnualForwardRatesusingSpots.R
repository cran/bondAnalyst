#'Calculates Semi-Annual Forward Rates using the given Spot Rates.
#'@details
#'According to information provided by Frank J. Fabozzi (2008), the method \code{saForwards()} is developed to calculate Semi-Annual Forward Rates using the given Spot Rates. Here, \code{spots} is vector of given 1-period (6-month) spot rates, \code{BGN} is six monthly period in which Forward Rate begins (for example  a value of 1 would mean 1-period from now (that is six-months from now) and value of 2 would means two six-monthly periods from now (or 1 years into future) and so on), and \code{APLY} means number of six-monthly periods for which the Forward Rate Applies (for example, a value for 1 means for six-months and APLY value of 4 means for two years so, BGN=2 and APLY=1 means computing implied Forward Rate of 1 year from now for six-months; this is also called a six-months forward rate from one year into future), \code{t} is a vector of number of six-month periods ranging from 1 to any specified number of six-month periods for which the Spot Rates are available, and \code{n} is number of six-month periods under consideration.
