#'Calculates Future Value of Money Market Instruments using the given Discount Rate.
#'@details
#'According to information provided by Adams and Smith (2019), the method \code{fvMmiUsingQuotedDiscRate()} is developed to calculate Future Value of Money Market Instruments using the given Discount Rate for the values passed to its four arguments. Here, \code{pvMmi} is present value of the Money Market Instrument, \code{daysToMaturity} is number of days till the maturity, \code{daysInYear} is taken to be 360, and \code{mmQuotedDiscRate} is Money Market Quoted Discount Rate. For example, an output value of 10,000,000 dollars denotes the value of redemption amount to be paid at maturity for a Money Market Instrument that had the present value of 9,943,125 dollars.
#'@param pvMmi A number.
