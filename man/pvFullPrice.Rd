\description{
Calculates Present Value of the Full Price of the Bond including Accrued Interest.
}
\details{
According to information provided by Adams and Smith (2019), the method \code{pvFullPrice()} is developed to calculate the Present Value of the Full Price of the Bond including Accrued Interest. Full Price of the Bond is the present value of the coupon interest and principal payments with each cash flow discounted by Yield-To-Maturity rate. Here, \code{n} is number of periods, \code{ytm} is yield-to-maturity, \code{coupon} is dollar value of the coupon payment, \code{maturityVal} is maturity Value, \code{daysCpnToSettle} is the number of days from the last coupon payment to the settlement date, and \code{daysCouponPeriod} is the number of days in the coupon period.

\examples{
pvFullPrice(n=8*2,ytm=0.06/2,coupon=3,maturityVal=100,daysCpnToSettle=57,daysCouponPeriod=180)
pvFullPrice(n=10,ytm=0.104,coupon=8,maturityVal=100,daysCpnToSettle=0,daysCouponPeriod=0)
