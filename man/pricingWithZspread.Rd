\description{
Calculates Bond Price using the given value of a Z-Spread and spot rates taken from the spots curve.
}
\details{
According to information provided by Adams and Smith (2019), the method \code{pricingWithZspread()} is developed to compute Bond Price using the given value of a Z-Spread and spot rates taken from the spots curve. Here, \code{cpns} is vector of Coupon Payments,  \code{spots} is a vector of spot rates taken from the spots curve, \code{t} is a vector of number of years ranging from 1 to any specified number of years under consideration, \code{mv} is maturity value of the bond, \code{n} is number of years for which spots are available, and \code{zSprd} is given value of a Z-spread.

pricingWithZspread(cpns=c(5,5,5),spots=c(0.0486,0.0495,0.0565),t=c(1,2,3),mv=100,n=3,zSprd=0.0234)
pricingWithZspread(cpns=c(rep(5,3)),spots=c(0.0486,0.0495,0.0565),t=c(1:3),mv=100,n=3,zSprd=0.0234)
